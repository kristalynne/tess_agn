Work in progress. This program plots the TESS pixel image with the DSS contours of the same region, and allows the user 
to interactively select the pixels to include in their extraction. This can be imported directly into eleanor. 

Future directions will include the ability to de-select pixels, and to input a TIC ID instead of common name or object coordinates.
